<h2>Change of date and place of the Balkan Youth Championships</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>The event was initially awarded to Serbian city Krusevac, where a the stadium is being renovated. The initial date was 2 August 2014. Unfortunately the track cannot be ready on time, therefore Serbia had to cancel their hosting of the event. Bulgaria steped in and offered to organise the Youth champs in Sliven on 15 May 2014. The change was approved by the Congress.</p>

<h2>Balkan Athletics Extraordinary Congress</h2>
&nbsp;

<h2>13th March 2014 Sofia</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>The highest forum of Balkan Athletics took place in Grand Hotel Sofia on 13 March 2014. All the 15 Member Federations were present. The Congress was also attended by Jean Gracia, Vice president of European Athletics, Ahmad Al Kamali, IAAF Council Member, President of GCC and UAE Athletics Federation and Yannis Nicolaou, IAAF Communications Manager.</p>
<br />
<img src="2014/images/Balkan Athletics Extraordinary Congress1.jpg" /><br />
&nbsp;
<p>The Congress took historical decision to amend the competition format of the major Balkan Championships. The Balkan in-stadia events so far reflected the format and programme of the European Team Championships. They were practically team championships with only one athlete per event allowed in competition. It happened that a good athlete with better result could not receive medal, being the second athlete from a country, thus participating out-of-competition. This was not fare to the athletes. The idea of the new format is to have actual individual championships were the title reflects the content.</p>
&nbsp;

<p>From now on each country will be able to be represented by two athletes in each events. There will be no more out-of-competition athletes. The total number of participants per country had to be limited in order to protect the hosting country. With 15 member Federations quota participants had to be restricted, otherwise the coast for the organisers would be too high.</p>
<br />
<img src="2014/images/Balkan Athletics Extraordinary Congress 2.jpg" /><br />
&nbsp;
<p>The Congress approved the <a href="http://www.balkan-athletics.eu/pdf/Balkan_Calendar_2014.pdf" target="_blank">2014 Calendar</a> of events. One more Balkan Championships was added to the 9 traditional events: a Balkan Youth Mountain Running Championships. The first edition will be held on 11th June 2014 in Smolyan, BUL, as rehearsal to the International Youth Mountain Running Cup to be held there in 2015.</p>
&nbsp;

<p>Balkan Athletics will compete again as a team in the DecaNation meeting on 30 August 2014 in Angers, FRA. It was decided to select the participants among the champions from the Balkan Senior Championships next July in Pitesti, ROU. Balkan Athletics will also compete as one team on a Cross Country match against the GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE) on 21 November in Dubai. The best 8 athletes from the Balkan Cross Country Championships will represent the association there.</p>
&nbsp;

<p>During a press conference which followed the congress, a special European Athletics Women Leadership Award was presented by Jean Gracia to Anelia Nuneva &ndash; winner of European and World prizes, national record holder of 60m and 200m.</p>
&nbsp;

<p>Balkan Athletics President Dobromir Karamarinov offered a plaque of gratitude to the association&rsquo;s General Sponsor Corporate Commercial Bank in respect of their generous support.</p>

<h2>Athletics at School for the Balkan countries</h2>
<img border="0" height="245" src="http://www.balkan-athletics.eu/images/Teteven 2013-1.jpg" width="400" />
<p>A fruitful cooperation between ABAF and the IAAF Regional Development Centre in Moscow took place in Bulgaria, following the personal recommendation of IAAF Vice President Sergey Bubka and the authorization of Malek El Hebil, Director of IAAF Member Services Department.</p>
<img border="0" height="265" src="http://www.balkan-athletics.eu/images/Teteven 2013-2.jpg" width="400" />
<p>An &ldquo;Athletics at School&rdquo; seminar for the Balkan countries was held in the beautiful town of Teteven from 7th to 11th May 2013. It was attended by 20 participants from eight Balkan countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro and Romania. The other four ABAF members (Armenia, Moldova, Serbia and Turkey) were not represented because they are already implementing IAAF Kids Athletics programme in their countries. The beautiful scenery and fresh air of the peaceful town combined with the excellent conditions that hotel &ldquo;Olymp&rdquo; offered as accommodation and sports facilities were of great benefit to the success of the seminar. Vadim Zelenichok, Director of the RDC Moscow gave his high evaluation of the great organisation and the conditions offered in the sport centre of Teteven.</p>
<img border="0" height="265" src="http://www.balkan-athletics.eu/images/Teteven 2013-3.jpg" width="400" />
<p>Lecturer was Bostjan Bradeshko from Slovenia. Young, enthusiastic and eager to deliver his profound knowledge he demonstrated high professionalism during the lectures and practical sessions. With his talent to connect with students and his deep understanding of the IAAF Kids Athletics Programme and the characteristics of the different age groups for which it is designed, Bostjan was a true leader. He managed to run the project smoothly and kept the attention of the audience during lectures and practical sessions.</p>
<img border="0" height="265" src="images/Teteven 2013-4.jpg" width="400" />
<p>Over 50 children from a local school took part in the practical demonstration on the stadium in Teteven. A true athletics star, Tereza Marinova, Olympic Champion in Triple Jump, joined the group inspiring and motivating the children to choose athletics as their favourite sport.</p>
<img border="0" height="265" src="http://www.balkan-athletics.eu/images/Teteven 2013-5.jpg" width="400" />
<p>The participants, who were athletics coaches working with youngsters and teachers of physical education in primary schools were trained to implement athletics in an enjoyable way and make it accessible to every kid in form of various games. Different opinions were shared on many topics based on personal experience&ntilde; in various backgrounds which contributed to the quality of the training process. The whole time there was a friendly working atmosphere with jokes and high spirits.</p>
<img border="0" height="265" src="http://www.balkan-athletics.eu/images/Teteven 2013-7.jpg" width="400" />
<p>It was a successful project that will strengthen the partnership with IAAF and will benefit for the implementation of the IAAF Kids Athletics Programme on the Balkan area.</p>

The 15th Balkan Indoor Championships took place on 18 February 2012 in Istanbul, as a test event for the World Indoors three weeks later. All 11 ABAF federations were represented plus two guest nations; athletes from Slovenia and Azerbaijan took part out-of-competition, thus helping the overall level of athletes&rsquo; performances.

<p></p>
It was a historical event being the first Balkan Indoor Championships held in Istanbul and the first international competition on the newly built Atakoy Sports Arena. Until now only the Greek capital had suitable facilities to host the Balkan Indoors, therefore all previous editions were held in Athens. There is still work to be done in terms of construction details and final touches; though the LOC is confident they will manage to finish everything on time.

<p></p>
The Arena is compact and cosy; has 7500 seats located very close to the track which gives the audience the unique experience of literally &ldquo;feels the athletes&rsquo; breath&rdquo;. Two giant HD video boards where tested with live TV broadcast. A small warm-up area beneath the North stand was used for the Balkan event, though a bigger warm-up track will be available for the World championships in the adjacent basketball hall, which will be connected to the athletics arena by a tunnel.

<p></p>
For the first time a 4 x 400m relay was held during a Balkan Championships &ndash; it was a non-scoring event this year, as it is not included in the Balkan Championships Regulations. ABAF Competition Committee will study the options of making the relay part of the official indoor programme.

<p></p>
The general organisation of the Balkan Indoor Championship was very good, proving the capacity of Turkish Athletic Federation to deliver an excellent World event in Istanbul, 9-11 March 2012. We wish our colleagues good luck and success!

<h2>Croatia is becoming the 11th ABAF Member Federation</h2>

<p></p>
<br />
<br />
Following the decisions of ABAF Congress held in Tenerife on 13 October 2011, the athletic federations of Croatia and Slovenia were invited to join the Association of the Balkan Athletics Federations. From a geographical, historical and political perspective those countries belong to the Balkan area. They are considered part of the Balkan family as Balkan athletics championships were held in Zagreb and Ljubljana in the past.
<p></p>
<br />
<br />
Croatia gave a positive answer right away, thus becoming the eleventh ABAF member federation, sharing rights and responsibilities with the federations of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and Turkey. The formal membership is to be officialised by next ABAF Congress; in the meantime our Croatian friends are warmly welcomed to all ABAF activities. We believe they would contribute to the strength and prestige of the Association.

<h2>Sergei Bubka is coming to Pravets for the Balkan Gala</h2>
<a href="http://www.balkan-athletics.eu/gala2011.html"><img border="0" height="400" src="gala2011-iaaf.jpg" width="400" /></a>

<p></p>
IAAF Vice President Sergei Bubka (UKR) is going to visit Bulgaria as special guest for the First Balkan Athletics Gala. The Gala is organised by the Association of the Balkan Athletics Federations (ABAF) and will take place in hotel &ldquo;RIU Pravets Golf and Spa Resort&rdquo; on 1 December 2011. Representatives of the 10 ABAF member federations will attend the ceremony as well as the Balkan Athletes of the Year (one male and one female) who will be awarded with special prizes.

<p></p>
Aside from his leading position in the IAAF, Sergei Bubka is member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), in his sports career he has won many times World and Olympic gold medals and he is the reigning world record holder in pole vault. The IAAF will be represented at the Gala in Pravets also by Ahmed Al Kamali (UAE), newly elected IAAF Council Member and President of the Athletic Federation of the United Arab Emirates.

<p></p>
The visit to Bulgaria of Bubka and Al Kamali was negotiated during IAAF Congress in Daegu by the President of Bulgarian Athletic Federation Dobromir Karamarinov. Bubka and Al Kamali confirmed today their attendance to the ceremony in Pravets.

<p></p>
IAAF guests and their colleagues from the ABAF will arrive to Bulgaria on 30 November 2011. Before the Gala they will visit the newly rebuild Stadium in Pravets, which should be entirely reconstructed by 1 December 2011 in order to meet all IAAF certification requirements.

<p></p>
&ldquo;The visit of Bubka and Al Kamali to Bulgaria is just another IAAF recognition for the work of the Balkan Association&rdquo; said Dobromir Karamarinov, ABAF President. &ldquo;There is a tendency in our sport to increase the role of the Area Associations - we all saw in Daegu what the concurrence is at world championships. The young athletes should grow up and develop in a suitable concurrence for their age. We are good friends with Bubka and Al Kamali but we also have close partnership and professional relations with them.

Although Albania is a mountainous country with the highest peak Korab (2764m), the mountain running as sport discipline has just stared to develop in this part of the world. It is one of the first time, that a country with no Mountain running tradition is hosting the Championships. Even more, in 2011 Albanian runners participated World&#39;s top event for the first time.
