The 15th Balkan Indoor Championships took place on 18 February 2012 in Istanbul, as a test event for the World Indoors three weeks later. All 11 ABAF federations were represented plus two guest nations; athletes from Slovenia and Azerbaijan took part out-of-competition, thus helping the overall level of athletesí performances. 
</p>
It was a historical event being the first Balkan Indoor Championships held in Istanbul and the first international competition on the newly built Atakoy Sports Arena. Until now only the Greek capital had suitable facilities to host the Balkan Indoors, therefore all previous editions were held in Athens. There is still work to be done in terms of construction details and final touches; though the LOC is confident they will manage to finish everything on time. 
</p>
The Arena is compact and cosy; has 7500 seats located very close to the track which gives the audience the unique experience of literally ìfeels the athletesí breathî. Two giant HD video boards where tested with live TV broadcast. A small warm-up area beneath the North stand was used for the Balkan event, though a bigger warm-up track will be available for the World championships in the adjacent basketball hall, which will be connected to the athletics arena by a tunnel. 
</p>
For the first time a 4 x 400m relay was held during a Balkan Championships ñ it was a non-scoring event this year, as it is not included in the Balkan Championships Regulations. ABAF Competition Committee will study the options of making the relay part of the official indoor programme. 
</p>
The general organisation of the Balkan Indoor Championship was very good, proving the capacity of Turkish Athletic Federation to deliver an excellent World event in Istanbul, 9-11 March 2012. We wish our colleagues good luck and success!

<h2>Croatia is becoming the 11th ABAF Member Federation</h2>
</li><p></p><br></br>
Following the decisions of ABAF Congress held in Tenerife on 13 October 2011, the athletic federations of Croatia and Slovenia were invited to join the Association of the Balkan Athletics Federations. From a geographical, historical and political perspective those countries belong to the Balkan area. They are considered part of the Balkan family as Balkan athletics championships were held in Zagreb and Ljubljana in the past. 
</li></li><p></p><br></br>
Croatia gave a positive answer right away, thus becoming the eleventh ABAF member federation, sharing rights and responsibilities with the federations of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and Turkey. The formal membership is to be officialised by next ABAF Congress; in the meantime our Croatian friends are warmly welcomed to all ABAF activities. We believe they would contribute to the strength and prestige of the Association.

Aside from his leading position in the IAAF, Sergei Bubka is member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), in his sports career he has won many times World and Olympic gold medals and he is the reigning world record holder in pole vault. The IAAF will be represented at the Gala in Pravets also by Ahmed Al Kamali (UAE), newly elected IAAF Council Member and President of the Athletic Federation of the United Arab Emirates. 
<p></p>
The visit to Bulgaria of Bubka and Al Kamali was negotiated during IAAF Congress in Daegu by the President of Bulgarian Athletic Federation Dobromir Karamarinov. Bubka and Al Kamali confirmed today their attendance to the ceremony in Pravets. 
<p></p>
IAAF guests and their colleagues from the ABAF will arrive to Bulgaria on 30 November 2011. Before the Gala they will visit the newly rebuild Stadium in Pravets, which should be entirely reconstructed by 1 December 2011 in order to meet all IAAF certification requirements.
<p></p>
ìThe visit of Bubka and Al Kamali to Bulgaria is just another IAAF recognition for the work of the Balkan Associationî said Dobromir Karamarinov, ABAF President. ìThere is a tendency in our sport to increase the role of the Area Associations - we all saw in Daegu what the concurrence is at world championships. The young athletes should grow up and develop in a suitable concurrence for their age. We are good friends with Bubka and Al Kamali but we also have close partnership and professional relations with them.

Although Albania is a mountainous country with the highest peak Korab (2764m), the mountain running as sport discipline has just stared to develop in this part of the world.
It is one of the first time, that a country with no Mountain running tradition is hosting the Championships. Even more, in 2011 Albanian runners participated World's top event for the first time.
