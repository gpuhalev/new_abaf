                        <p>The current President of Balkan Athletics Dobromir Karamarinov was unanimously re-elected for another 4-years term. A new governance structure was also adopted, therefore Balkan Athletics will be governed now by the following bodies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Congress. It is composed of two Delegates per Member Federation, meets once a year and each Federation has one vote. The Congress has the supreme authority. </li>
                            <li>Presidential Council, composed of the Presidents of the member federation, or in case the President is not available, a person specifically nominated by the President. It meets at least twice a year along with the Balkan Indoor and the Balkan Senior Championships.</li>
                            <li>Executive Board, composed of the President, two Vice Presidents who are elected for 4 years term, a Financial and Marketing Director and a General Secretary, the latter two appointed by the President. </li>
                            <li>President</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Fatih Cintimar (TUR) and Slobodan Brankovic (SRB) were elected Vice Presdients and Ion Sandu (ROU) was appointed Marketing Director. Galia Puhaleva (BUL) continues as General Secretary.</p>

                        <p>The Balkan Athletics family extended with one more member federation. Israel was affiliated as the 16th member federation and will be hosting the next Congress in September 2016.</p>
                        <p>The Prime Minister of Serbia Aleksandar Vu&#269;i&#263;  gave a reception for Coe, Hansen, Bubka, Karamarinov and the Serbian Federation President and General Secretary Veselin Jevrosimoc and Slobodan Brankovic.
