<img src="2017/images/DK1.JPG" style="float:left; width: 200px; margin:0 10px 5px 0; border-style: ridge; "><p style="">Dear Friends in Balkan Athletics, 
<br>

<br>
In less than a month a new event will take place in Istanbul – the first edition of the Balkan Indoor Junior Championships.
<br>
<br>
The hosting federation of Turkey is the initiator and the driving force behind this event. They are also an important partner of Balkan Athletics in many other projects and are investing lots of energy and funds in our activities. We have to show them strong support by assuring a good number of participants in this new competition.</p>

<div class="mainHidden" name="terrorism2">

<p>I realise that some parents could be reluctant to send their children to Istanbul in view of the recent terrorist attack on New Year’s Eve. It is however important to give chance to our U20 athletes who have been waiting for this event to compete on the international stage and gain sustainable experience. We should stick to our agenda and carry on with our regular live.</p>

<p>I want to assure you on behalf of our hosts that Turkish Athletic Federation is taking extra precautions and have put in place maximum security provisions. The teams will be safely guarded in the hotel as well as in the competition arena and will be escorted by police cars during transfers from place to place.</p>


<p>I hereby invite all Balkan Member Federations to send their best athletes to the inaugural Balkan U20 Indoor Championships Istanbul 2017 and ensure strong representation.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon in Istanbul!</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br>
Dobromir Karamarinov<br>
Balkan Athletics President</p>

<p>Young Sara Kolak (21) surprisingly won the Olympic title in Rio, defeating the favorites in javelin throw and setting a national record of 66.18. She had suggested of her huge potential a few months earlier when she won the bronze at the European Championships in Amsterdam. Unfortunately she was not able to attend the ceremony and receive her Balkan Rising Star award because she was ill.</p>

 Bekir Karayel and Olivera Jevtic are the new Balkan Half Marathon Champions.</a></p>

 <h6><i>30 October 2016 Podgorica</i></h6>

    <div class="newsMain">

<p>The 5th edition of the Balkan Half Marathon Championships took place in Montenegrin capital Podgorica.

<p>Turkey took the first and third place of the men’s race with Bekir Karayel 1:07:46 and Arslan Ercan, 1:09:34. Karayel is only 21 years old, though has a huge potential. Moldovan Maxim Raileanu won the silver medal with 1:09:34. They were awarded by the President of the Athletic Federation of Montenegro Milorad Vuletic.</p>

<img src="/images/BHMC 2016 Winners Men.JPG">

<p>Never aging Olivera Jevtic (SRB) won the women’s race in 1:12:25. It looks like the race in Podgorica fits her very well as she won the Balkan Marathon last year on the same course. The representative of the hosting country Sladjana Perunovic took the silver medal in Podgorica with a result of 1:16:49. Less than a month ago Sladjana Perunovic won also the Balkan Marathon in Sofia. Turkish Busra Nur Koku took the bronze with 1:18:05.</p>

 <img src="2016/images/DK Fatih Cintimar.jpg" align=centre>

           <p>Dear Friends in Balkan Athletics, </p>
<p>We were all shocked and frustrated by the terrorist attack on Istanbul Ataturk airport last night. We know some federations have started to reconsider their participation in the Balkan Junior Championships in Bolu, Turkey on 2-3 July 2016. We understand the worries and fear all participants and their families are experiencing in view of this threat and cannot blame parents for trying to keep their children safe. </p>

<p>On the other hand we cannot let terrorism rule our world and command our activities. Balkans have always been a good example of unity and integrity. Balkan Athletics must remain strong and reliable. We cannot bend under the antihuman challenge of a bunch of confused people. We should stay together and carry on with our scheduled events.</p>


<div class="mainHidden" name="terrorism">

            <p>I hereby call upon all Member Federations to keep on with their activities and send their teams to Bolu, as previously planned. Balkan Junior Championships shall be carried on with reinforced security measures, as announced by the hosting federation. Turkish Federation, Bolu Governorship and Bolu Municipality have invested great efforts and care in the preparation of the event, therefore it is our obligation not to let them down. I am sure you all understand the necessity of a common resistance to terrorism in the world.</p>

<p>I trust in your positive response and remain confident in the success and safeness of the Balkan Junior Championships 2016.</p>

<p>Respectfully, <br>
Dobromir Karamarinov<br>
Balkan Athletics President
